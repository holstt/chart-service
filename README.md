# Chart Service

![nodejs](https://img.shields.io/badge/node--js-15-blue)

Generating beautiful charts server side using the chart.js library.

## About

This service uses the Node.js version of the popular chart.js library (aka. **chartjs-node**) to render charts on the server. As such, you are no longer limited to the browser but can use the charts anywhere :)

## Getting started

As getting chartjs-node to work is quite cumbersome, you should run the service using Docker (a Dockerfile is provided).  

## Usage
